GREEDY K-ANONYMITY ALGORITHM - METRICS REPORT
==============================================

Dataset Information:
- Original records: 32561
- Anonymized records: 32561
- Suppressed records: 0
- Suppression rate: 0.000

Generalization Analysis:
- Algorithm approach: Greedy (exhaust one QI before trying others)
- Dataset: Full Adult dataset (32,561 records)

Privacy Metrics:
- Overall Distortion: 0.562
- Overall Precision: 0.396
- Suppression Rate: 0.000

Individual QI Analysis:

Algorithm Characteristics:
- Strategy: Greedy selection (lowest utility loss first)
- Behavior: Completely generalizes one QI before trying others
- Result: Tends to over-generalize age and education to suppression
- Efficiency: Fast but suboptimal utility preservation

Notes:
- Greedy approach prioritizes computational speed over utility
- Results in significant suppression of age and education
- May not be optimal for real-world privacy applications
