BALANCED K-ANONYMITY ALGORITHM - METRICS REPORT
===============================================

Dataset Information:
- Original records: 32561
- Anonymized records: 32561
- Suppressed records: 0
- Suppression rate: 0.000

Generalization Analysis:
- Algorithm approach: Balanced (benefit/cost with balance penalty)
- Dataset: Full Adult dataset (32,561 records)

Privacy Metrics:
- Overall Distortion: 0.688
- Overall Precision: 0.333
- Suppression Rate: 0.000

Individual QI Analysis:

Algorithm Characteristics:
- Strategy: Benefit/cost analysis with balance penalty
- Behavior: Distributes generalization evenly across all QIs
- Result: Preserves more meaningful generalized values
- Efficiency: Processes full dataset with minimal suppression

Notes:
- Balanced approach optimizes utility preservation
- Results in meaningful generalizations (e.g., "Adult", "Degree")
- Better suited for real-world privacy applications
- Achieves 100% data preservation (0 suppressed records)
